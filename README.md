Insights into global fishery sustainability and food security considering current trends in sustainable fishing, consumption, and species production

More than one-third of the worldâ€™s population rely on fish as a mainstay in their diet, as it is seemingly the cheapest source of protein globally (Tidwell & Allan, 2001). This has led to a drastic increase in fishing and the boom in fish farming. But as demand rises faster than supply can regenerate, fisheries are now over-exploited and depleted, with only 10% of worldwide stocks left (The World Counts, n.d.). The urgency is not lost on us, along with many organisations who are racing to find solutions to mitigate this issue, but without much success.

Completely stopping the whole world from consuming seafood is not possible, so instead, we should focus our efforts on making fishing more sustainable. There are two types of fishing - wild catching, and fish farming, also known as aquaculture. The mass fishing of wild fishes is considered more unsustainable, as it impacts the biodiversity of the ocean (McKeever, 2022), and places stress an wild fish populations. Aquaculture provides a controlled farming environment and is hence the more sustainable option.

With this background knowledge and the datasets in hand, we explore our research question : Considering current trends in sustainable fishing, consumption, and species production, what conclusions can we make for global fishery sustainability and food security?
